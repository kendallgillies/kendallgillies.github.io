<h2> Kendall Gillies</h2>

<p> 
Hi, I’m Kendall, that’s me in the red shirt above (<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Catfish">or is it?</a>) and I am a Mathematician turned Data Scientist.  I know you are asking yourself why I would want to switch from a glamorous career as a Mathematician to a humble Data Scientist (if not, just go with it), so I’ll give you a semi-quick version of events.  
</p><p>
I fell in love with math because I like solving puzzles. Most problems have their own creative solutions and I loved seeing what clever trick would make a normally rigorous three page proof into a beautiful three line proof.  While I had fun working on my dissertation, a computationally heavy numerical approximation for ordinary differential equations, I was unsatisfied with its impracticality.   With a switch to Mathematical Modeling I was off to a postdoctoral position at Pacific Northwest National Labs.  Being the only mathematician at the Sequim location gave me the chance to help people solve a wide variety of problems.  When I started looking at what my potential career trajectory might be, I realized I enjoyed myself the most when I was able to use my mathematical and statistical abilities to solve other peoples problems.  So, I switched to Data Science, a field that prides itself on taking complex mathematical concepts and translating them for the public masses.  I am now currently enrolled in the <a href="www.thisismetis.com">Metis Data Science Bootcamp</a> learning how to be a Data Scientist.  
</p><p>
At Metis we work on projects and I wanted a way to share my projects with the world (more realistically, just my parents…Hi Mom and Dad!).   I wanted the blog to reflect both my technical, mathy side and my more fun, creative side.  
</p><p>
Enough with the boring stuff, here are some pictures of my adorable dogs and lizard (ever since I saw Jurassic Park in third grade I wanted a t-rex…I had to settle).
